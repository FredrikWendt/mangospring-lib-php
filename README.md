TODO
----

Must:
  * Get proof of concept through (auth issues currently)
  * Add configuration of mangoapps settings:
   * domain,
   * user & password, and
   * project or group to post to (or none, to post to the user''s wall)
  
Nice:
  * Add "Test Configuration" button/step


Installation
------------

Right now, you need to manually clone this into a directory in the plugins directory: ```.../wp-content/plugins/mangospring/``` to get it to work with WordPress.
